## Lectures

### [Elia Bruè](https://dec.unibocconi.eu/people/elia-brue) (Bocconi University)
#### Title 
The fundamental groups of manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature.
#### Abstract 
In 1968, Milnor proposed a conjecture stating that Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature have finitely generated fundamental groups.
The first part of the course will focus on comprehending this conjecture and discussing the progress made in addressing it throughout the years.
In the subsequent part, we will discuss recent work with Naber and Semola, where we provide a counterexample to Milnor's conjecture. More specifically, we construct a seven-dimensional manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature whose fundamental group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$. The key ideas behind the construction will be explained, and the resulting manifold's geometry will be described in detail.

### [Adam Parusinski](https://math.univ-cotedazur.fr/~parus/) (Côte d'Azur University)
#### Title 
Introduction to semialgebraic and subanalytic geometry.
#### Abstract 
The goal of this course is to give an introduction to semialgebraic and subanalytic sets and mappings with emphasis on the properties used in various areas of differential geometry and analysis. In particular we cover such subjects as Łojasiewicz Inequalities, decompositions and stratifications. One lecture will be devoted to the metric properties of these sets including the L-regular decomposition, subanalytic preparation theorem and Lipschitz stratification. We also discuss the integration on subanalytic sets, local densities, and the dependence of integrals on parameters in families.

## Talks 

### [Luigi De Rosa](https://dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/luigi-de-rosa/) (University of Basel)
#### Title 
Intermittency and Minkowski content in turbulence.
#### Abstract
In 1941 Kolmogorov theorized that all p-th moments of increments of the velocity in a turbulent flow have 1/3 has a universal regularity exponent. However, downward deviations from K41 prediction are experimentally observed. This phenomenon is nowadays known as "intermittency", which theoretical physicists, starting from Landau, linked to the spottiness of the region where the dissipation is supported. We propose a couple of Minkowski-type notions of dimensions, one Eulerian and one Lagrangian, which lay down a setup to make Landau's objection quantitative. The approach is quite geometrical and it is in fact part of a more general picture in which most of the PDEs in fluid dynamics fall.

### [Stefano Spirito](https://www.disim.univaq.it/StefanoSpirito) (University of L'Aquila)
#### Title 
On the inviscid limit for 2D incompressible fluid.
#### Abstract
We review some recent results concerning the inviscid limit for the 2D Euler equations with irregular vorticity. In particular, by using techniques from the theory of transport equations with non smooth vector fields, we show that solutions of the incompressible 2D Euler equations obtained from the ones of the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations via the vanishing viscosity limit satisfy a representation formula in terms of the flow of the velocity and that the strong convergence of the vorticity holds. Moreover, we also prove a rate of convergence. The talk is based on results obtained in collaboration with Gianluca Crippa (Univ. Basel) and Gennaro Ciampa (Università Milano Statale).

### [Barbara Nelli](https://www.disim.univaq.it/BarbaraNelli) (University of L'Aquila)
#### Title 
The Jenkins-Serrin Theorem reloaded.
#### Abstract
Jenkins and Serrin in the sixties proved a famous  theorem   about minimal graphs in the Euclidean 3-space with infinite boundary values. After reviewing the classical  results, we show how to solve the Jenkins-Serrin problem in a 3-manifold with a Killing vector field. This is a joint work with A. Del Prete and J. M. Manzano.

### [Carlo Mantegazza](https://cvgmt.sns.it/HomePages/cm/) (University of Naples)
#### Title 
Stability for the surface diffusion flow.
#### Abstract
We study the surface diffusion flow in the flat torus, that is, smooth hypersurfaces moving with the outer normal velocity given by the Laplacian of their mean curvature. This model describes the evolution in time of interfaces between solid phases of a system, driven by the surface diffusion of atoms under the action of a chemical potential. We show that if the initial set is sufficiently "close" to a strictly stable critical set for the Area functional under a volume constraint, then the flow actually exists for all times and asymptotically converges to a "translated" of the critical set. This generalizes the analogous result in dimension three, by Acerbi, Fusco, Julin and Morini.

### [Emanuela Radici](https://www.disim.univaq.it/EmanuelaRadici) (University of L'Aquila)
#### Title 
On curvature and five gradients inequality on manifolds.
#### Abstract
Introduced almost ten years ago, the five gradients inequality has been used to provide estimates on Sobolev norms of minimizers involving the Wasserstein distance. In conjunction with the JKO scheme, this inequality can grant compactness for the minimizing movement scheme. We investigate the geometric and functional meaning of the five gradients inequality in two generalizations. In the setting of Lie groups the proof naturally suggests that it is a second order optimality condition for the Kantorovich potentials, while in general compact Riemannian manifolds the curvature plays a role. This is a joint work with Simone Di Marino and Simone Murro.

### [Emanuele Tasso](https://www.asc.tuwien.ac.at/~etasso/) (TU Wien)
#### Title 
Rectifiability of a class of integralgeometric measures and applications
#### Abstract
In his textbook 'Geometric Measure Theory', Federer proposed the following problem: (Q) Is the restriction of the m-dimensional integralgeometric measure to a finite set a m-rectifiable measure? With this motivation, after a brief introduction to the integral geometric measure, I will discuss how rectifiability issues in the spirit of (Q) play an important role in some variational problems. As a sort of unifying theory, I will then introduce a novel class of measures in the euclidean space based upon the idea of slicing. The central result of this talk will follow, which is a sufficient condition for rectifiability in the above class. Two main applications will be shown: the solution to Federer's problem, as well as a novel rectifiability criterion for Radon measures via slicing, the latter being reminiscent of White's rectifiable slices theorem for flat chains. If time permits, I will discuss how to extend the main result to the Riemannian case by means of the notion of transversal family of maps. In the very last part of the talk I will propose some related open problems.
