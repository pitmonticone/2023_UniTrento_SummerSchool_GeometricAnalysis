## Lectures

### [Elia Bruè](https://dec.unibocconi.eu/people/elia-brue) (Bocconi University)

#### Title 

The fundamental groups of manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature.

#### Abstract 

In 1968, Milnor proposed a conjecture stating that Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature have finitely generated fundamental groups.
The first part of the course will focus on comprehending this conjecture and discussing the progress made in addressing it throughout the years.
In the subsequent part, we will discuss recent work with Naber and Semola, where we provide a counterexample to Milnor's conjecture. More specifically, we construct a seven-dimensional manifold with nonnegative Ricci curvature whose fundamental group is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$. The key ideas behind the construction will be explained, and the resulting manifold's geometry will be described in detail.

### [Adam Parusinski](https://math.univ-cotedazur.fr/~parus/) (Côte d'Azur University)

#### Title 

Introduction to semialgebraic and subanalytic geometry.

#### Abstract 

The goal of this course is to give an introduction to semialgebraic and subanalytic sets and mappings with emphasis on the properties used in various areas of differential geometry and analysis. In particular we cover such subjects as Łojasiewicz Inequalities, decompositions and stratifications. One lecture will be devoted to the metric properties of these sets including the L-regular decomposition, subanalytic preparation theorem and Lipschitz stratification. We also discuss the integration on subanalytic sets, local densities, and the dependence of integrals on parameters in families.

## Talks 

### [Luigi De Rosa](https://dmi.unibas.ch/en/persons/luigi-de-rosa/) (University of Basel)

#### Title 

Intermittency and Minkowski content in turbulence.

#### Abstract

In 1941 Kolmogorov theorized that all p-th moments of increments of the velocity in a turbulent flow have 1/3 has a universal regularity exponent. However, downward deviations from K41 prediction are experimentally observed. This phenomenon is nowadays known as "intermittency", which theoretical physicists, starting from Landau, linked to the spottiness of the region where the dissipation is supported. We propose a couple of Minkowski-type notions of dimensions, one Eulerian and one Lagrangian, which lay down a setup to make Landau's objection quantitative. The approach is quite geometrical and it is in fact part of a more general picture in which most of the PDEs in fluid dynamics fall.

### [Stefano Spirito](https://www.disim.univaq.it/StefanoSpirito) (University of L'Aquila)

#### Title 

On the inviscid limit for 2D incompressible fluid.

#### Abstract

We review some recent results concerning the inviscid limit for the 2D Euler equations with irregular vorticity. In particular, by using techniques from the theory of transport equations with non smooth vector fields, we show that solutions of the incompressible 2D Euler equations obtained from the ones of the 2D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations via the vanishing viscosity limit satisfy a representation formula in terms of the flow of the velocity and that the strong convergence of the vorticity holds. Moreover, we also prove a rate of convergence. The talk is based on results obtained in collaboration with Gianluca Crippa (Univ. Basel) and Gennaro Ciampa (Università Milano Statale).

### [Barbara Nelli](https://www.disim.univaq.it/BarbaraNelli) (University of L'Aquila)

#### Title 

The Jenkins-Serrin Theorem reloaded.

#### Abstract

Jenkins and Serrin in the sixties proved a famous  theorem   about minimal graphs in the Euclidean 3-space with infinite boundary values. After reviewing the classical  results, we show how to solve the Jenkins-Serrin problem in a 3-manifold with a Killing vector field. This is a joint work with A. Del Prete and J. M. Manzano.
