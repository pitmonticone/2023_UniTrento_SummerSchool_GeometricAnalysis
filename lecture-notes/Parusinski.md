(1) P and Q have at least k + 1 common roots (counted with multiplicities), (2) the degree of the **gratest** common divisor of P and Q is ≥ k + 1

In particular if f : Rn → R is a polynomial then {x ∈ Rn;f(x) > 0} is defnable. As a corollary we obtain that every semi-algebraic set is definable in S.

Exercise II.25. Let A ⊂ Rn be definable and connected. Show that A is definably arc-wise connected : for all x,y ∈ A there is a defiinable continuous γ : [0,1] → A such that γ(0) = x and γ(1) = y.

3. Derivabilty.

d) for each i ∈ I, Bti is a definable family of ε-flat cells.
More precisely, let us, for each d < n, fix a finite covering Gd,n = 􏰅 Θεd,ν . Then we may require that for each i ∈ I, di = dim Bti, there exists νi such that for eavery (x, t) ∈ Bi

We call a cdcd (cylindrical definable cell decomposition) of Rn, see definition II.11, k-regular if all the functions ζD,i of the definition II.11, are of class Ck. Then, the cells are k-regular. The first part of the next theorem is an easy application of exercise II.30.. The second part is more delicate and follows from the IFT (Implicit function theorem) similarly to exercice II.31

suppose that φ and the first order partial derivatives of φ extend to the boundary. It is a nice exercise to show that these properites imply that the graph of φ is a C1 manifold. (One can easily reduce to the case U being the half space xd ≥ 0.)
